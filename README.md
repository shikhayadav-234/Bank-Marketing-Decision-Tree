# 🤖 PRODIGY_DS_03 – Decision Tree Classifier with Bank Marketing Dataset

## 🎯 Task Objective:
Build and visualize a Decision Tree Classifier using the **Bank Marketing Dataset** to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit.

---

## 🧩 Dataset Used:
- **Source**: UCI Machine Learning Repository
- **Data Format**: Integrated into Power BI

---

## ⚙️ Key Steps Performed:

1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Removed irrelevant columns such as `contact` and `poutcome`
   - Replaced `"unknown"` values in `job` and `education`
   - Converted categorical variables into numeric format where necessary

2. **Feature Selection**
   - Selected important columns for predicting `y` (term deposit subscription)

3. **Model Building in Power BI (Python Script)**
   - Used `DecisionTreeClassifier` from `sklearn.tree`
   - Split data into training and testing sets within Power BI's Python script editor
   - Trained and visualized the tree using `plot_tree`

4. **Evaluation**
   - Evaluated accuracy using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score
   - Displayed results using card visuals and matrix in Power BI

## 📊 Visual Insights:
- Tree visual showing decision paths
- Classification report output
- Prediction success/failure visualized via chart
